Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods, 
or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively.

Generic Methods

You can write a single generic method declaration that can be called with arguments of different types. 
Based on the types of the arguments passed to the generic method, the compiler handles each method call appropriately. 

Following are the rules to define Generic Methods:

All generic method declarations have a type parameter section delimited by angle brackets (< and >) that precedes the method's return type
Each type parameter section contains one or more type parameters separated by commas. A type parameter, also known as a type variable, is an identifier that specifies a generic type name.
The type parameters can be used to declare the return type and act as placeholders for the types of the arguments passed to the generic method, which are known as actual type arguments.
A generic method's body is declared like that of any other method. Note that type parameters can represent only reference types, not primitive types (like int, double and char).
Example: public <E> E method(E string) {...}


Bounded Type Parameters

Bounded type parameters restrict the type of parameters that can be used, for example: only Numbers, etc...
To declare a bounded type parameter, list the type parameter's name, followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound.
Example: public <T extends Number> T meetod(T number) {...}

Generic Classes

A generic class declaration looks like a non-generic class declaration, except that the class name is followed by a type parameter section.
