A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a 
specialized syntax held in a pattern. 
They can be used to search, edit, or manipulate text and data.

The java.util.regex package primarily consists of the following three classes

A Pattern object is a compiled representation of a regular expression. Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\regular expression");

A Matcher object is the engine that interprets the pattern and performs match operations against an input string.
Mather m = p.matcher("String");

m.find(), m.group()

A PatternSyntaxException object is an unchecked exception that indicates a syntax error in a regular expression pattern.
