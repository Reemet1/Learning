Normally, when we work with characters, we use primitive data types char.
However in development, we come across situations where we need to use objects instead of primitive data types. 
In order to achieve this, Java provides wrapper class Character for primitive data type char.

char ch = 'a';
char uniChar = '\u039A';
char[] charArray = {'a', 'b', 'c'};

If you pass a primitive char into a method that expects an object, the compiler automatically converts the char to a Character for you.
This feature is called autoboxing or unboxing, if the conversion goes the other way.

A character preceded by a backslash (\) is an escape sequence and has a special meaning to the compiler. The newline character (\n) 
has been used frequently
If you want to put quotes within quotes, you must use the escape sequence, \", on the interior quotes.

Some methods:

isLetter() - Determines whether the specified char value is a letter.
isDigit() - Determines whether the specified char value is a digit.
isWhitespace(), isUpperCase(), isLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), toString().
