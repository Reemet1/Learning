Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects.

The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. 
If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer & String Builder Classes.

Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods.
Using String's static format() method allows you to create a formatted string that you can reuse, as opposed to a one-time print statement.
string = String.format("Tekst %f %d %s", floatVar, integerVar, stringVar);

String methods:

charAt(), compareTo(), "string1".concat(string2), equals(), getBytes(), indexOf(ch char), length(), indexOf(String str,int from),
replace(), split(), subString(), trim(), toUpperCase(), valueOf().
