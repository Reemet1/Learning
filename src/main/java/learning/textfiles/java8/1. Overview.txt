JAVA 8 (aka jdk 1.8) is a major release of JAVA programming language development.
Java 8 is expected to change the way programmers code their programs.

New Features:

Lambda expressions - Adds functional processing capability to Java.
Method references - Referencing functions by their names instead of invoking them directly. Using functions as parameter.
Default method - Interface to have default method implementation.
New tools - New compiler tools and utilities are added like ‘jdeps’ to figure out dependencies.
Stream API - New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing.
Date Time API - Improved date time API.
Optional - Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly.
Narhborn, a Javascript engine - A Java-based engine to execute JavaScript code.

Sorting using Lambda expression example:

private void sortUsingJava8(List<String> names){
      Collections.sort(names, (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2));
}
