Inheritance is a process in which one class (subclass) inherits all fields and methods of another class (superclass),
except private fields and methods.

Subclass extends Superclass

A subclass can extend only one superclass, but implement many interfaces. A superclass can have many subclasses.

A default constructor is a constructor without parameters, though body can be defined.

Superclass default constructor is always invoked no matter the type, starting from the class in the top of the hierarchy.

If superclass has parametrized constructor but no explicit default constructor, all the constructors
in a subclass must invoke any of the superclass parametrized constructor using super() as the first thing.
