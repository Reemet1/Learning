Polymorphism is a property of objects to admit a type of any of its superclass (and its own class).

An object initialized using a subclass constructor admits any of its superclass (or its own class) type, 
but cannot have a type of any of its own subclasses. That means new Subclass() instanceOf Superclass is true.
Superclass constructor cannot be used to initialize an object of subclass type.

SuperclassType object = new SubclassConstructor();

Subclass type objecy can invoke superclass methods, but
Superclass type object cannot invoke subclass methods.
