In Object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. 
In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

ABSTRACT CLASS

Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )

But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.

If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated, though it can be used as a reference type.

To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.

If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.

A constructor of an abstract class can be called only from the subclass.

If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the actual implementation of that method to be determined by child classes, 
you can declare the method in the parent class as an abstract. Example: modifier returnType abstract method(parameters p);

Any class inheriting the current class must either override the abstract method or declare itself as abstract.
Eventually, one descendant class has to implement the abstract methods.
