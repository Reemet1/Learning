Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms, that means to be type compatible to more than one class.

There are two distinct types:
1 - Reference type, type of the reference variable
2 - Object's type, type of the instiantiating class

By default every object has the type of its own instantiating class and of class Object.

An object admits a type of its instantiating class and any of its instantiating class's superclass regardless of the reference type.
(subclassObject instanceOf SuperClass) == true.

A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type.

The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object.
That's because when dealing with variables of the same type, it is not guaranteed that all of the objects
of this type could call the method that would be defined for example in just one of the subtype class.

Virtual method - superclass method which the JVM checks before compiling, though subclass method of the same name is called.
