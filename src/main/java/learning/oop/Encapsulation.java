 * and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
 * Therefore, it is also known as data hiding. In OOP, other classes do
 * not need to know how the intrinsics of an encapsulated class or
 * how it computes the results. Also the class can have total control
 * over what is stored in its fields.
