         *  obtains lock2 and proceeds to wait for lock1. When thread1 wakes and proceeds
         *  to wait for lock2, both threads get stuck in a deadlock waiting for each other's
         *  locks to be released. These could happen in the same method or also
         *  in different classes and methods.
         *
         *  There are 2 possible solutions for deadlocks:
         *  1) Thread obtains one lock at a time, but this is very limiting in applications, better is
         *  2) Threads obtain locks in the same order
