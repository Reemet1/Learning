/**
 * Synchronized blocks have multiple drawbacks:
 * 1) Threads that are blocked waiting for a lock can't be interrupted, they are
 *    blocked until they get the lock they are waiting on.
 * 2) Synchronized block must be within the same method
 * 3) It cannot be tested whether an object's intrinsic lock is available or
 *    find out any other information about that lock.
 * 4) A thread cannot timeout after it has waited for a lock for a certain time
 * 5) When multiple threads are waiting on the same lock, the lock is not aqcuired by
 *    first-come-first-server, that means that when a thread blocks on a given lock first
 *    does not mean that it will acquire the lock first.
 *
 *    To get through those drawbacks, an objects that implement a Lock interface can be used
 *    for locking mechanism, while gaining the previously named functionalities.
