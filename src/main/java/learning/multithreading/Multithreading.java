/**
 * A process is a unit of execution that has its own memory space (heap).
 * Examples: Java console application, JavaFX application.
 *
 * A Thread is a unit of execution within a process. Each process
 * can have multiple threads.In Java, every process has at least one thread - main thread.
 *
 * Each thread has a thread stack, which is a memory space only accessed by that thread.
 * Threads enable parallel execution of code, the term for this is concurrency.
