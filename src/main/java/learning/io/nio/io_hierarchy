InputStream - input stream of bytes
-- FileInputStream -  obtains input bytes from a file in a file system
-- FilterInputStream - contains some other input stream, which it uses as its basic source of data,
                       possibly transforming the data along the way or providing additional functionality.
-- -- DataInputStream - lets an application read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in
                        a machine-independent way

OutputStream - output stream of bytes
-- FileOutputStream - output stream for writing data to a File or to a FileDescriptor
-- FilterOutptStream -  transforming the data along the way or providing additional functionality
-- -- DataOutputStream - lets an application write primitive Java data types to an output stream in a portable way

Reader - input stream of characters
-- BufferedInputStream - buffer for character-input
-- InputStreamReader - reads bytes and decodes them into characters
-- -- FileReader - convenience class for reading character files

Writer - output stream of characters
-- PrintWriter - prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.
-- BufferedOutputStream - buffer for character-output
-- OutputStreamWriter - converts input characters into bytes and writes them out
-- -- FileWriter - convenience class for writing character files
